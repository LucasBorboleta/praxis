# Praxis

*Praixs* is a turn-based board game relying on regular 6 faces dices and their mutations. The actual capacities of a cube is represented by its top face. The cubes move of a board made of squared tiles, can fight each other, and can modify the surrounding tiles. A mutation occurs when a cube moves on a mutating tile.
